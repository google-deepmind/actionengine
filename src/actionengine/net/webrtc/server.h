/**
 * @file
 * @brief Provides the WebRtcServer class for handling WebRTC data channel
 * connections.
 *
 * This file defines the `WebRtcServer` class, which is responsible for
 * accepting incoming WebRTC data channel connections and turning them into
 * `WebRtcWireStream` instances. The `WebRtcServer` class is designed to
 * work with an `act::Service` instance, which handles the processing of the
 * `WebRtcWireStream` instances, including application logic, session
 * management, and error handling.

/**
 * Represents an acceptor for WebRTC data channels, opening an act::Service
 * instance for incoming connections.
 *
 * This class is designed to handle incoming WebRTC data channel connections,
 * which it accepts through a signalling server, turning successfully accepted
 * connections into `WebRtcWireStream` instances. The WireStream instances are
 * then passed to the `act::Service` for further processing.
 *
 * The server abstraction in Action Engine is intentionally not standardised
 * across all protocols, and it is only expected from the server to
 * accept incoming connections and pass them to the service. The service is
 * expected to handle the connections, including sending and receiving
 * wire messages, managing the lifecycle of the connections, and
 * handling any logical errors that may occur during the communication.
 *
 * Protocol-specific lifecycle management is better handled by the WireStream
 * implementation and not by the server itself. Server implementations
 * may take care of other considerations, such as security, load balancing,
 * access and flow control, and are unrestricted in doing so.

 public:
  /**
   * Constructs a WebRtcServer instance.
   *
   * @param service
   *   The `act::Service` instance which will handle the WireStream instances
   *   created by this server from incoming WebRTC data channel connections.
   * @param address
   *   The address to bind the server to. Defaults to `0.0.0.0`, which
   *   means the server will accept connections on all available interfaces.
   * @param port
   *   The port to bind the server to. Defaults to `20000`.
   * @param signalling_address
   *   The address of the signalling server to connect to. Defaults to
   *   `localhost`.
   * @param signalling_port
   *   The port of the signalling server to connect to. Defaults to `80`.
   * @param signalling_identity
   *   The identity of the server in the signalling server. Defaults to
   *   `server`. This identity is used to identify the server in the signalling
   *   server and to establish connections with clients.
   * @note
   *   Notice that no special measures are taken to protect the server's
   *   identity, so in production setups, signalling servers MUST make sure
   *   that the identity cannot be impersonated by a malicious client.
   * @param rtc_config
   *   Optional configuration for the WebRTC connections. If not provided,
   *   a default configuration will be used. The configuration can include
   *   settings such as STUN/TURN servers, port ranges, and other WebRTC
   *   parameters.
